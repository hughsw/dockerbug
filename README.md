# Break the Docker engine

This repo has code that reproducibly breaks the Docker engine daemon on Docker for Mac.

See https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3487 for background and discussion.

### Note:
> This code is intended to break the Docker engine on Docker for Mac that the local `docker` command talks to.
If the code succeeds, the symptom will be that no network connections can be made from the host to running containers.
You will have to restart the Docker engine in order to be able to connect to running containers.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your Mac:
* NodeJS version 8.12 or higher
* `npm` version 6.4.1 or higher
* `bash` version 3.2.57 or higher
* Docker for Mac 2.0.0.2 (Docker engine 18.09.1)

```bash
bash-3.2$ node --version
v8.12.0
bash-3.2$ npm --version
6.4.1
bash-3.2$ bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin17)

```

## How to use

No process can be listening on port 3306.
Docker for Mac must be running.

To break the Docker engine, run the shell script `./go.sh` in a terminal.
It will need you to confirm that you want to try to break the Docker engine.
If so, hit Return and wait patiently for up to 60 seconds.

Log messages from both a MariaDB container and various shell and NodeJs processes will be interleaved.

A successful breakage of the Docker engine will be indicated by logging messages in the terminal that end with something like this:
```
  ...

```
The smoking-gun part is this:
```
Got a packet bigger than 'max_allowed_packet' bytes
```

If you run `go.sh` again, it will eventually fail with a connection timeout.  This is the symptom that the Docker engine is broken.  (If you get a connection refusal, that suggests the Docker engine isn't even running.)
You can also run any other image/container and you should get a timeout error when trying to connect to an exposed port from the host.


`go.sh` will leave a Docker container running MariaDB.
```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
a8893615e84d        mariadb:10.3        "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   13 minutes ago      Up 13 minutes       0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp   dockerbug
```
You can kill it with `./stop.sh`


You can restart the Docker engine via the Restart menu item under the Docker icon.

## Details

* `stop.sh` -- stops the MariaDB container, if any
* `go.sh [fileName]` -- starts the MariaDB container, runs `npm install`, runs `go.js fileName`
* `go.js` -- loads a blob from a file, connects to the DB with Sequelize, creates a table for blobs, sends the blob to the DB, boom!
